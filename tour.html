	<h2>KOLKATA TOURISM</h2>
	<P>“Calcutta is lovely. “Wherever you place a camera, you get a vision,” said Pradeep Sarkar, a famous writer and director, and he couldn't have been more right. The country's second largest city seems to be a magical town brought to life by a genius novel. The former British capital's old-colonial style buildings bring a certain beauty to the area, making it an absolute delight for the eyes. It's no surprise that many regard the bustling metropolis as the country's intellectual, educational, and creative capital! Take a stroll around North Kolkata to see how the noisy lifestyle of today's crowd works in complete balance against the backdrop of a bygone age. And then there's the food! Don't miss out on a delectably gastronomic experience in Kolkata's alluring food lanes. If the hustle and bustle of city life is starting to bother you, take a seat by one of the picturesque Ghats and let the hot tea make you forget about it! Well you want to stay a days or two in kolkata, Yatra.com entered the homestay market in India in 2015, offering fantastic homestay experiences to travelers as well as rewards to hosts. Yatra Homestays is the answer if you want to experience a unique holiday, savor the local flavors of a city, and prefer the comforts of a homely setting.Yatra currently has over 3500 homestay properties and is rapidly expanding. It has a stronghold in South India and most hill stations in North India, with these locations offering customers exclusive homestay experiences. Goa, Manali, Shimla, Coorg, and Wayanad are among its most popular homestay destinations.Remember to prepare for your trip and tour, The most important part of trip preparation is purchasing travel tickets and verifying your flight booking. If you're traveling for business or pleasure, you can't plan an itinerary until you've first booked your flights. If your travel arrangements are finalized, you must purchase an airline ticket.When you have a signed flight ticket booking in your lap, it looks like half the job is over. The whole process of looking for air connectivity between two cities, reviewing flight schedules, and settling on one that is most suitable for you can seem like a lot of work, particularly if you are in a rush to book your flights.</P>
