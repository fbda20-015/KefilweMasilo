    		<h2>The early period</h2>
    		<p>Back the Calcutta  was ruled by British government , the name kalikata appeared on the rent-roll of Mughal emperor Akbar (reigned 1556â€“1605) as well as in the Manasa-mangal of Bengali poet Bipradas (1495). (1495) Kolkata's history as a British settlement, known as Calcutta to the British, dates back to Job Charnock's establishment of a trading post there in 1690. Fort William was built in 1696 after a rebellion broke out in the nearby district of Burdwan. The rebels were easily crushed by the Mughal government, but the settlers' defensive structure of brick and mud remained. In 1698 the English obtained letters patent that granted them the privilege of purchasing the zamindari right (the right of revenue collection; in effect, the ownership)</p>

    		<h2>Pre-independance trouble</h2>
    		<p>Calcutta entered a difficult time at the turn of the twentieth century. In 1905, Lord Curzon, Viceroy of India, partitioned Bengal, declaring Dacca (now Dhaka, Bangladesh) the capital of eastern Bengal and Assam. Consistent protests resulted in the annulment of this partition in 1911, however at the time the capital of British India was relocated from Calcutta to Delhi, where the government could enact its policies. As Calcutta's population increased, so did the city's social problems, as did calls for home rule. Riots erupted in 1930 after nationalist leader Mohandas Gandhi called for noncompliance of unjust legislation. During WWII, Japanese air raids on the Calcutta docks caused extensive damage and loss of life. British India was about to be partitioned, and tensions between Muslims and Hindus were rising.</p>

    		<h2>Growth of the city</h2>
    		<p>In 1717, Mughal emperor Farrukh-Siyar allowed the East India Company free trade. Calcutta's development was greatly accelerated as a result of the agreement. When the Marathas from the southwest launched incursions against the Mughals in 1742, the English gained permission to dig an entrenchment that would later be used to form a moat. Sirj al-Dawlah, the nawab's heir, seized the fort and sacked the town in 1756.The British recaptured the city in 1757.A number of Europeans were imprisoned in a small lockup popularly known as the Black Hole of Calcutta, and many died. Calcutta was recaptured in January 1757 by Robert Clive, one of the founders of British power in India, and by the British admiral Charles Watson.</p>
